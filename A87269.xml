            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>MOST Beloved Son in Jeſus Chriſt; We great you with Health and our Apoſtolical Benediction. When from this ſublime poſt, exalted almoſt to Heaven, in which, as unworthy as we were of it, we are placed, We caſt our eyes upon ſo many faithful People that are committed to Our Paſtoral care; We are almoſt ready to expire with the exceſſive Grief and Melancholy we are affected with, at the view of all thoſe great calamities, to which they are expoſed by this cruel War, which at preſent afflicts almoſt all Chriſtendom. And therefore being deeply concerned at the great and piercing clamours of ſo many Perſons thereby expoſed to Deſtruction; And being ſo very well aſſured of your Majeſties pious inclinations, and of the great deſire you have, to promote the advantage of the Chriſtian Commonwealth, We have reſolved to employ with your Majeſty, the ſame Prayer we continually without ceaſing addreſs to the Fathers of Mercies, <hi>That it would pleaſe him to diſſipate thoſe dreadful Storms from whence ſo many Evils proceed, and to make them give place to a ſucceeding Calm of Peace ſo much deſired.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We hope, that taking into your Conſideration, the greatneſs of our Sorrow, and having a careful regard to the Miſeries of ſo many poor People, and the dying groans of thoſe that are daily ſlain in the War, you will be the more confirmed in the Inclination you have for Peace, and that you'l labour to augment it. And certainly when you ſhall have made a ſerious Reflection upon the ungovernable Licenciouſneſs of Soldiers, and upon the contempt that ſort of Men have for Sacred things, and upon the loſs of ſo many Souls as we have juſt occaſion to fear, Conſiderations which wound us to the heart with grief, We cannot doubt; but ſuffring your ſelf to be ſwayed by the motion of your natural Piety, you will readily form a Deſign for the procuring the repoſe of ſo many ruined People, the Reeſtabliſhment of God's Service, and the Salvation of Souls: Moſt ſure it is you can in no juſter or fitter manner acknowledge thoſe benefits, which the Authour of all Good has ſo abundantly beſtowed upon Your Majeſties Sacred Perſon, than by reeſtabliſhing the Heritage which the Lord Jeſus Chriſt left by his Teſtament, to his Church, before he aſcended into Heaven.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore employ your whole endeavours as far as in you lies, Moſt Beloved Son in Jeſus Chriſt, towards the eaſing of the Chriſtian Commonwealth from thoſe miſeries with which it is now afflicted; And propoſe for your aim, the Glory which they ſhall receive; who by procuring the Peace of that Commonwealth, ſhall benefit it with an unexpreſſible felicity, and the Applauſes of the People thereby Reſetled, who will never ceaſe to proclaim the juſt praiſes of the Authours of their tranquility.</p>
                  <p>As for Us, We will put in practice all that we can think of to facilitate to Your Majeſty, and to all the reſt of the Chriſtian Princes, the means of putting in execution a Work ſo uſeful and ſo advantagious.</p>

                  <p>YOUR Holineſſes Letter dated the 8th, of laſt Month, has ſufficiently informed us of the cruel di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbances you are affected with, at the view of thoſe many Evils which the Chriſtian People is overwhelmed with by the War at preſent enkindled almoſt every where, and of your Holineſſes care to moderate and calm the animoſities raging between the ſeveral Irritated Princes, and to diſpoſe them to Peace and Concord. And indeed the calamities which the Chriſtian Commonwealth ſuffers by this War ſo unjuſtly enterpriſed, together with thoſe it is farther threatned with thereby, no leſs afflict Us than they do your Holineſs.</p>
                  <p>But our comfort is, That God and our Conſcience bear Us Witneſs, that the fault cannot be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to Us, ſince We took not up Arms, but when there was a neceſſity ſo to do, for the Defence of the Empire, and of the People committed to our Protection, againſt thoſe who attacked them. The moſt inward thoughts of our Heart are ſo well known to your Holineſs, by the long acquaintance and converſe you have had formerly with Us, That you will eaſily believe, there could happen nothing more diſpleaſing to Us, than to ſee the Love We naturally are byaſſed with for the Peace, and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility of the Publick, to be continually diſobliged, and forcibly turned towards the contrary extrem, by freſh injuries daily perpetrated againſt Us, and above all things, by the Ambition and Malicious envy of France.</p>
                  <p>For the Reſpect which is univerſally granted to be due to the Publick Faith, and to Solemn Treaties, has not hitherto been of any force to bridle that Crown from violating them as often as they have been Sworn to. And to paſs under ſilence ſeveral other things, the Chriſtian World with ſighs beholds, and poſterity with horrour will hear related, that it has been poſſible for a King moſt Chriſtian, to fix upon a reſolution to ſtop the Rapid Courſe of our Victories over the Infidels, to break thoſe Bands of Amity We had but a little before renewed with him, and to make a freſh War upon Us, juſt at the moment when truſting in the Faith of thoſe Treaties ſo lately made with him, We lived in all manner of ſecurity, and to fill all Places with Murthers, Rapines, and Burnings, before he was pleaſed to inform Us for what Reaſon he Renewed the War, and what juſt pretence We had given him for it. Certainly it muſt needs have been done upon this principle, That it was much more eligible to trample under foot all things bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h Divine and Humane, than for <hi>France</hi> to have loſt the oppornity to extend her Limits to the Rhine-ward, and to leave to Us and the reſt of Chriſtendom, the leiſure neceſſary ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully to finiſh the War with the <hi>Turks,</hi> and to ſecure our Frontiers on that ſide.</p>
                  <p>And therefore the Auguſt Dignity with which We are inveſted, obliged Us to make the beſt Alliances We could, to defend our ſelves and People againſt the Arms of the moſt Chriſtian King, and at the ſame time againſt the Enemies of the Chriſtian Name, Who by a ſhameful union Act in conſort a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Us. 'Tis true the principal Condition of the Alliance by which we are engaged to our Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, is, That We ſhall not have power to hearken to any ſeparate Treaty of Peace, without firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting of it conjointly with them, but as we can very well anſwer for them, that they no leſs deſire than We, to ſee Peace Reeſtabliſhed in the Chriſtian World, by the Reinforcement of the Articles of Pacification concluded at the <hi>Pyrenean</hi> and <hi>Weſtphalian</hi> Treaties, which have been violated by <hi>France.</hi> It will be neceſſary above all things, for your Holineſs to employ all your beſt offices and that with the utmoſt efficacy you can, to induce the King of <hi>France</hi> to reſtore things to the State required by the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of thoſe two Treaties, as he himſelf teſtifies to be inclin'd to do.</p>
                  <p>If Your Holineſs can obtain from that Prince a thing ſo juſt, We will not be wanting on our ſide, to uſe our utmoſt endeavours, that the Pious Intentions of your Holineſs for the good of Chriſtendom, and the offer of your Paternal care and good offices for the advancement of Peace, which are to Us moſt acceptable, may be embraced by our Allies, and produce their deſired effect. This is what We thought our duty to Anſwer to your Holineſſes Letter, which was ſo pleaſing to Us, and which We have accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly done, with all due Reſpect to Your Holineſs; Whom We pray God long to preſerve both for the good of the Church in General, and Our own in Particular.</p>
